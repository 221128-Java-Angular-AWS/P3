## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## DevOps advice

A t2-micro/small will likely not be capable enough for your needs, so try to go for t2-medium with an Amazon Linux image build.   
The Jenkins script that we used is inside Jenkins-script.md.
